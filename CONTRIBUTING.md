# Contributing to Prism Browser

Thanks for your interest in contributing to Prism Browser.

Prism is a small, deliberate project focused on privacy, predictability, and clarity. Contributions are welcome, but changes are evaluated carefully against the project’s goals and threat model.

Please read this document before opening issues or pull requests.

## Project Values

Prism Browser prioritizes:

- Privacy by default
- Minimal and predictable behavior
- Local-only operation
- Clear, honest documentation
- Small and auditable changes

Features that increase complexity, background activity, or hidden behavior are unlikely to be accepted.

---

## Before Contributing

Before proposing changes, please:

- Read `README.md`
- Read `THREAT_MODEL.md`
- Understand the project’s stated goals and non-goals

If a proposal conflicts with these documents, it is likely out of scope.

## What Contributions Are Welcome

We especially welcome:

- Documentation improvements
- Threat model reviews and suggestions
- Bug reports with clear reproduction steps
- Small, focused fixes
- Privacy or security-related audits and analysis

---

## What Is Likely Out of Scope

The following are generally not accepted:

- Features promising anonymity or untraceability
- Background network services or cloud dependencies
- Telemetry, analytics, or usage tracking
- Large UI redesigns or cosmetic customization
- Feature parity with mainstream browsers

---

## Issues and Pull Requests

- Keep issues focused and specific
- Explain *why* a change is needed, not just *what* it does
- Prefer small, reviewable pull requests
- Expect discussion before significant changes are merged

Not all contributions will be accepted, and that’s okay.

## Tone and Conduct

Be respectful and constructive.

Prism Browser follows a simple rule:
> Disagree clearly, but act in good faith.

There is no tolerance for harassment or hostile behavior.
